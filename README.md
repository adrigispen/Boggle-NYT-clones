# Boggle

Just a lil game

## Status

Not yet done :D

### Boggle todos:

- Speed mode - need an 'End Game' button? How to end speed mode?
- Make it look better - CSS
- Remove word highlights and errors after timeout (half a second?)
- Refactor 'findWords' to go through each word in the dictionary, rather than trying BFS
- Stop using API?? Use dictionary instead
- Configure dictionary to not allow proper nouns, see what settings are possible

### Next up

- Add router and additional games
- Add BE - login, save scores, save high scores, etc. Need to write endpoints to save data and deploy via heroku
