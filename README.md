# Boggle

Just a lil game

## Status

Not yet done :D

## Todo:

Make it look better - CSS
Remove word highlights after timeout (half a second?)
Get all words! <- what kind of dictionary can I use? or DFS throwing away paths after no more words are possible? (e.g. with ht- or ws- or any other combo that isn't valid in English)
Use better API - this one is very slow & doesn't have all words
Fix CORS issues (learn more)
Add router and additional games
Add BE - login, save scores, save high scores, etc. Need to write endpoints to save data and deploy via heroku
