# GAMES

Just some lil games

## Status

Not yet done :D

### Boggle todos:

- Speed mode - need an 'End Game' button? How to end speed mode?
- Refactor CSS (it's terrible)
- Remove word highlights and errors after timeout (half a second?)
- Move it to a component

### Spelling Bee todos:

- Draw the board :weary: (currently shows letters in a column, the 'center' letter [the one you must use in each word] is listed first)
- Allow shuffling the outside letters
- Speed mode? maybe

### Next up

- Add router and Wordle
- Err rename repository
- Add BE - login, save scores, show stats, let you play with friends, etc. Need to write endpoints to save data and deploy via heroku, would need to rework scoring & gameplay... hmm.
