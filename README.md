Just a lil game

## Status

Not yet done :D

## Todo:

- Speed mode - need an 'End Game' button? How to end speed mode?
- Make it look better - CSS
- Remove word highlights after timeout (half a second?)
- Refactor 'findWords' to go through each word in the dictionary, rather than trying BFS
- Stop using API?? Use dictionary instead 
- Configure dictionary to not allow proper nouns, see what settings are possible
- Add router and additional games
- Add BE - login, save scores, save high scores, etc. Need to write endpoints to save data and deploy via heroku
